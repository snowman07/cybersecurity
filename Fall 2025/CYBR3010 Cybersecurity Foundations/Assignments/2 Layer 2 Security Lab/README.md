## Introduction
This document is about Data Link Layer (layer 2 of the OSI model). Switch (as well as bridge) is the common device operating here, which maintains an address table called MAC address table to efficiently switch frames between interfaces on the same Local Area Network (LAN). Simply put, it’s like a directory that links devices’ unique hardware addresses to the ports they’re connected to on a switch. When a switch receives a frame, it associates the MAC address of the sending device with the switch port on which it was received. Because switch is responsible for how devices communicate within LAN, data link layer is a common target for network attack. Therefore, this document will also tackle vulnerabilities in data link layer, compare results before and after the attack, and apply security measures to mitigate the vulnerabilities effectively.
