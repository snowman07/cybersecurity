## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 What is CTI?

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) refers to information and insights gathered, analyzed, and shared to understand and defend against current and future cyber threats. It provides organizations with actionable insights about ongoing and emerging threats, adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and vulnerabilities in their systems. (https://www.bluevoyant.com/knowledge-center/cyber-threat-intelligence-cti-definition-types-process)

To give you an image, I will reinforce my front door to which I will add locks and cameras. These extra locks allow me to deal with actors trying to force here every day. The CTI is used to detect when this takes place, it is a means of anticipation allowing me to see that people are trying to enter my home. -- François Deruty, COO Sekoia.io

> Threat - any potential damage that can cause negative impacts to the operations, assets, etc

> Intelligence - corporate capability to forecast changes.

> In short, cyberthreat intelligence is making sure that we are on top of the things. We're gathering data from our systems and analyzing this data to make sure if there are threats that could harm the organization, it could be prevented from happening.

### 1.2 What is Threat Actor

Threat actors, also known as cyberthreat actors or malicious actors, are individuals or groups that intentionally cause harm to digital devices or systems. Threat actors exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks and software to perpetuate various cyberattacks, including phishing, ransomware and malware attacks. (https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/threat-actor)

> Threat Actor - refer to individual of group of organization that seeks to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of computer systems, networks, or data for malicious purposes.

### 1.3 What is MITRE ATT&CK?

MITRE ATT&CK refers to a group of tactics organized in a matrix, outlining various techniques that threat hunters, defenders, and red teamers use to assess the risk to an organization and classify attacks. Threat hunters identify, assess, and address threats, and red teamers act like threat actors to challenge the IT security system. (https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/mitre-attck#:~:text=MITRE%20ATT%26CK%20refers%20to%20a,an%20organization%20and%20classify%20attacks.)

> It is a framework developed by the MITRE corporation. It provides structured and comprehensive understanding of threat actors or adversaries behavior in different stages of a cyber attacks. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOkkAfVAFyc)

ATTA&CK - Adversarial, Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge
> Adversarial - these are the threat actos or the attackers

> Tactics - high level objectives that adversaries aim to achieve during the cyber attack. Represents “why” or the reason an adversary is performing an action.

> Techniques - specific methods or actions that adversaries use to accomplish their objectives within each tactics. Represents “how” adversaries achieve tactical goals by performing an action.

> Common Knowledge - collective understanding and awareness of the tactics techniques and procedures (TTP)

> Sub-techniques, a more specific or lower-level description of adversarial behavior.

> Procedures, specific implementation or in-the-wild use the adversary uses for techniques or sub-technique
